    </h1></center>
    <h2>5. Are there any differences between ur hometown and NYC?</h2>
    <p>  There are no big differences between here Seoul and NYC due to the fact that they are both a huge city. If I have to pick one, it would be the park. Since Seoul is so much smaller than New York, there are fewer parks in the city. We do have parks but the scale is much smaller. But we have bigger and cleaner transportation for sure.  </p>
